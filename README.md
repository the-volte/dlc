Simple demo to show DLC not working with ARM64 in CircleCI  

# Build locally

```
docker build .
```

The first time the build will take at least 10s because of the sleep command.

Build it again: (with a timer)

```
time docker build .
```
Now the build is almost instant! Wonderful!

Note the 'Using cache' step.

# Building in Circle CI

Set up the project to run using the supplied `.circleci/config.yml`.

Unfortunately the DLC doesn't work with Circle CI :(

After the initial build, update the project by changing this README file.

Instead of using cache, it is removing the intermediate containers?
